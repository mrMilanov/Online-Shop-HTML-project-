# Online-Shop-HTML-project-

This is one of my HTML projects, featuring a simple website with three pages showcasing a variety of "products for sale". 
The primary goal of this project was to practice and experiment with various web development techniques I recently learned.

Key Features:
Back to Top Button: A functional button that scrolls the page back to the top.
Dark Theme Option: A toggle for switching between light and dark themes.
Slideshow: A basic image slideshow to display products.
Search Bar: A search bar is present, but it is non-functional at this stage.
Please note, this project is purely for practice and not meant to be a fully functional e-commerce site. Iâ€™m sharing it here in case anyone finds it useful or helpful for learning purposes :)
